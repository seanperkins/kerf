# Decisions log (append-only)

- **scaffold** — Toolpath moves are in machine coordinates; `MachineCoordinates` (CAMCore) is the
  single material→machine mapping for XY origin and Z-zero mode. Generators think in depth
  below the material top.
- **scaffold** — Document geometry uses a fixed material frame (lower-left = 0,0). The XY origin
  choice only affects G-code, so moving the origin never moves the design.
- **scaffold** — Safe Z and home Z are stored as heights above the material top (VCarve style);
  `home` XY is in machine coordinates.
- **scaffold** — Arcs in `Move` carry an absolute machine-XY centre; the post converts to
  incremental IJ (Mach4 default) or linearises.
- **scaffold** — Drilling is emitted as explicit G0/G1 pecks (no G81/G83) for portability.
- **scaffold** — CGeom exposes a C API (not C++ interop) so Swift targets build without
  `-cxx-interoperability-mode`. Boost dependency trimmed to the Voronoi headers +
  `boost/cstdint.hpp` + Boost.Config.
- **scaffold** — Voronoi input is snapped to an integer grid (`scale`, default 10000/unit);
  edges come back pre-sampled with inscribed radius so V-carve does not need parabola math.
- **scaffold** — Seeded tool library uses fixed UUIDs (`00000000-0000-4000-8000-00000000000N`)
  so documents referencing seeded tools stay valid.
- **scaffold** — Generic GRBL profile uses `M0` (pause) for tool changes since GRBL 1.1 has no M6.
- **scaffold** — Validator checks the toolpath XY *extent* against travel (the job origin's
  position on the bed is unknown to Kerf).
- **scaffold** — Swift targets use Swift 5 language mode under tools-version 6.0 to avoid
  strict-concurrency friction; public model types are still `Sendable`.
- **cam-2d** — Generators build `[CutPoint]` (material XY + depth) and emit through
  `Ops2D/Support/ToolpathBuilder`, the only place that turns them into `Move`s (via
  `MachineCoordinates`); it retracts to safe Z before every XY rapid and ends at safe Z.
- **cam-2d** — Arcs: toolpaths are computed as polylines (Clipper round-join offsets at the
  document tolerance), then `ArcFitter` re-fits G2/G3 arcs (≤180°, ≥3 chords, within 2× tolerance)
  on constant-depth runs. Ramps and tabs stay linear. `ProfileParameters.preferArcs = false` turns
  fitting off for profiles.
- **cam-2d** — Profiles use the even-odd region of ALL selected closed vectors, so nested vectors
  become islands: "outside" on a frame cuts outside the outer edge and inside the hole. Open
  vectors are always cut on the line, alternating direction each pass with no retract.
- **cam-2d** — Climb (clockwise spindle) keeps the finished part on the right of travel. So outside
  profiles run CW, while inside profiles and pocket walls run CCW and pocket islands run CW. Closed
  vectors cut "on" behave like outside.
- **cam-2d** — Tabs:
  - The raised length along the toolpath is tab length + tool diameter, so the bridge left in the
    part equals the tab length.
  - Added an additive `TabSettings.spacing: Double?`. When set, it overrides the count.
  - Triangular tabs peak at the tab top in the middle.
- **cam-2d** — Ramps:
  - Smooth: linear descent over max(length, Δ/tan(maxAngle)), then the ramp section is re-cut.
  - Zigzag: an even number of back-and-forth legs within `length`.
  - Spiral: one helical lap per pass plus a final flat lap.
  - Open chains always use zigzag. When a lead-in is enabled the ramp is skipped, because the
    plunge happens in the waste at the lead start.
- **cam-2d** — Plunges rapid down to a gap (0.05"/1 mm, never more than safe Z) above material
  known to be cleared (the top, or the previous pass depth), then feed at the plunge rate.
- **cam-2d** — Pocket offset clearing:
  - Each component is cut inside-out. A ring waits only for the deeper rings adjacent to it.
  - Rings and raster lines are linked at depth when a straight move, or a walk along the
    tool-centre boundary, stays inside the tool-centre region and is ≤ 2× the tool diameter.
    Otherwise the tool retracts.
  - Stepover is clamped to 95% of the diameter.
- **cam-2d** — Clearance tool:
  - The larger tool clears the whole pocket.
  - The primary tool then cuts the wall contour, plus offset-ring fragments near the rest material
    (the pocket minus the big tool's morphological opening).
  - The clearance tool is ignored unless it is larger than the primary tool.
- **cam-2d** — Drilling:
  - One hole per closed path, or per point-like path, de-duplicated. Arc-only paths use their
    exact centre; others use the bounds centre.
  - Pecks are explicit G0/G1 moves. Between pecks the tool retracts to `retractHeight` (capped at
    safe Z), then rapids back to 0.02"/0.5 mm above the previous peck.
- **cam-2d** — `ToolpathStats` (Ops2D/Support) computes cut and rapid length and an estimated time:
  Σ length/feed + rapids/rapidRate + dwells + an allowance per tool change. The preview's
  `MachiningTimeEstimator` can delegate to it.
- **cam-2d** — Fluting and Texture are implemented too (same folder):
  - Fluting ramps over `rampFraction` of the length (cosine when smooth). Symmetric flutes
    alternate direction.
  - Texture uses a seeded SplitMix64 to place sine-shaped dips along lines at `angle`, retracting
    between strokes.
